Hello there, this is a breif introduction of myself. 

I'm a graduate in Computer Science and Mathematics from the Australian National University. After my graduation at december 2022, I started my carrer as a research assistant at [QuantEcon](https://quantecon.org) under the supervision of Professor [John Stachurski](https://johnstachurski.net). (This nice and neat website was built and lauched by me :D)

After being one of the lead developers at QuantEcon, I left the organisation with 1 year's experience. Then with several months' hardwork, I began my internship as a full-stack developer at [Capability Wise](https://www.capabilitywise.com.au/about-us/) where I managed to have more experience in a commercial IT firm.

Currently I'm based in Canberra and looking for new opportunities in local IT industry. My skill sets focus on data engineering and machine learning, but beginner's software development tasks also won't be challenging to me. You can find my CV [here](/assets/cv.pdf).

Apart from the serious talks, I'm creative and adventurous in life. My two favourate but dangerous hobbies are riding motorbikes and skiing. I also love exploring this land on 4 wheels, the longest single trip was a 2600km trip from Melbourne to Canberra via Adeleide and Wagga Wagga.
